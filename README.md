# Work Item Deep Copy

## What it does
This is the source code for a tool to deep copy work items in Team Foundation Server.
The inital version of this tool has been published years ago (2011) here for Team Foundation Server 2010: https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/cd89c5d3-4816-4f22-b04e-a397cc606be6 

## About the tool
The tool copies all work items related to a work item you select. It creates a "history link" to the original items. See details here: https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/cd89c5d3-4816-4f22-b04e-a397cc606be6 

## About the code
This was rather a proof vor feasibilitiy than a product. Be aware that the tool and the code has some rough edges and usability is limited. 

## What you should do with it
Use it, modify it, update it. 

## Whom to thank
Since that day several people asked me to update or open source the tool. Things were a little complicated as the actual owner of the source code wasn't me but my former company. 
It turns out that my previous employer is still pretty awesome and is fine with open sourcing the code. So if you benefit from the code be aware that the guys at http://www.conplement.de/ are the true heros here and feel free to give them a thumbs up on their facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/conplement/?ref=ts&fref=ts.
